This is Computer Graphics Course Lab Project, 

My project name is "Air Strike", I build this on openGL. 

Project Description:
In this game I have an aircraft, this aircraft can travel through an Environment. I write the 
code of the game like it will generate the environment over and over again with some 
stars/asteroid. My job will be to kill those astrieds by sooting missiles. I measure the position
of the asteroid and if my missile's position and asteroid position will be at the same position
then it will detect the collsion, and the I distroid that asteroid and increment the point of 
a player by 1. (N.B: There is a bug in point incrementing system, I found where is the problem is but
for now I have limited amount of time to finish the game, so here is a gap to fixed this type of problem)

Have to be work in future:
1) 1st of all I have to fixed the point incrementing bug.
2) For now I am not checking if the aircraft collied with the astoried or not, If I will give any
   option in future I will also measure it as the missile collied. If the aircraft collied with the
   asteroid then I will deceremtnt the aircraft life line and on that way the game will be finished.
   So, It can be say that my game is little bit incomplete but I belive I could fixed this in
   future.
